# TA.Gui
TA.Gui is a tool for non-developers and business users to automate web apps

# Why This
Insanely easy. Lightning fast. Open-source.

TA.Gui converts automation flows in natural language into lines of JavaScript code for CasperJS & PhantomJS to perform their web automation magic. For example, TA.Gui will instantly convert the flow below into ~100 lines of JavaScript code and perform the series of steps to download a Typeform report automatically. The flow can be triggered from scheduled job, command line, REST API, direct URL, email etc.
