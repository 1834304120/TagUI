Write flows (scripts) in simple TagUI language and automate your web, mouse and keyboard interactions on the desktop.

TagUI is free to use and open-source. It's easy to setup and use and works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

In TagUI language, you use _steps_ like `click` and `type` and interact with _identifiers_, which includes images, screen coordinates, or even text using OCR:

```
https://www.typeform.com

click login
type username as user@gmail.com
type password as 12345678
click btnlogin

download https://admin.typeform.com/xxx to report.csv
```
